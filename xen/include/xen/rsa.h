 * This limit is somewhat arbitrary. Technically, the smallest modulo
 * which makes sense at all is 15 = 3*5, phi(15) = 8, size 4 bits. But
 * for ridiculously small keys, not all odd e are possible (e.g., for
 * 5 bits, the only possible modulo is 3*7 = 21, phi(21) = 12, and e =
 * 3 don't work). The smallest size that makes sense with pkcs#1, and
 * which allows RSA encryption of one byte messages, is 12 octets, 89
